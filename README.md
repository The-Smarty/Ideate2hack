**Problem Statement**
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, in which the tissues in the joint break down over time. It is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. So early detection of disease is crucial for effective treatment. Sometimes, doctors may not be available to figure out if someone has this knee problem. Current methods relying on manual interpretation often led to delays and inaccuracies. Our proposed solution uses image preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of X-ray data and employs the powerful Convolutional Neural Network architecture. This approach focuses on extracting crucial features from X-ray images, specifically targeting joint spaces, bone density, and osteophytes. Through rigorous testing and validation against expert radiologistâ€™s assessments, the proposed system ensures both reliability and efficiency in identifying the presence and severity of osteoarthritis. The model generates a text message as a result. The model (chatbot) answers the queries related to the result. This helps to enhance accuracy and efficiency, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes. This technology represents a critical advancement in the field of osteoarthritis diagnosis and management.


We deploy the deep learning model in the website. The website also contains the chatbot to answer the queries related to the result given by the model.
